# Vim

## 查找

suppose you want to learn more about what `Ctrl-P` does in insert mode. If you merely search for `:h CTRL-P`, you will be directed to normal mode's `Ctrl-P`. This is not the `Ctrl-P` help that you're looking for. In this case, search instead for `:h i_CTRL-P`. The appended `i_` represents the insert mode. Pay attention to which mode it belongs to.
