Welcome. This knowledge base started as my private corner of the web – a place to diligently collect reading notes, code snippets, and personal insights. It served simply as my own organizational tool for the knowledge I was accumulating.

Over time, the desire to share what I've learned prompted me to open this space to others. The content largely centers on computer-related topics, including programming languages (like Python and Flutter), computer science foundations (data structures, algorithms), web development practices, and machine learning explorations, complete with illustrative code examples. You will also find occasional entries reflecting on personal experiences and notes from various books.

This site is intended as a continuously evolving resource, reflecting ongoing learning. In the spirit of sharing, it's [open source](https://github.com/luoxufeiyan/wiki.luoxufeiyan.com/), and [e-book in Markdown versions](https://github.com/luoxufeiyan/wiki.luoxufeiyan.com/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) are available for download if you prefer offline access. References are included for proper attribution where applicable.

This knowledge base is provided 'as is,' representing my current understanding, without any form of warranty.
