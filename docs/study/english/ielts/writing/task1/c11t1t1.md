Recently, citizens are arguing about whether the authority should focus on road or railway. It' s generally acknowledged that the financial budget is limited. So how to choose between them seems very tricky. I totally stand for the government should establish more railway than roads.


From my point of view, establish more railway can link one city to another. Nowadays, almost every city has specific functional district: like house estate, factory district or economy district(like a shopping mall or a plaza), road link those districts smoothly. But road seems ineffective when it across cities. if you drive (or take a coach) to another city, no to speak of traffic jams, you must stand for uncountable intersection lights. Here's the outcoming of the railway, it always can send you on time. In addition, it also reduces the air pollution which car and coach make.


On the country, although it's convenient to drive on roads, the government should stop using taxpayers money to build more roads which raise citizen's commuting time rapidly. Secondly, poor air qualities of cities would never reverse once all outer residents only could access cities by roads. In a nutshell, the government should not build new roads which encourage inhabitant drive their private car.
